The New Relic .NET Kata
=====================

Using New Relic and Azure Cloud Services (emulated or not) see how many things you can find and fix to make this app perform fast!

Step 1
-------
[Sign up](http://newrelic.com) for New Relic, get your license key and install the agent.  You can watch a [video on getting started](http://newrelic.com/resources/training) with the New Relic agent to help get you started. The New Relic agent will help you find and solve the performance issues in this application as well as help you see the complete impact of your changes.

Step 2
-------
[Download and install](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/net/) the Windows Azure SDK. The Azure compute and storage emulators will be used to support the execution of this MVC4 application 

Step 3
-------
Get the code. The code is waiting to be forked on [github](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dot-net-kata)

Step 4
-------
Install the New Relic nuget package:
Install-Package NewRelicWindowsAzure

Step 5
-------
Fix the code / Solve as many of the Katas as you can. There are 7 distinct Katas in this application that can be torn apart and fixed by using your awesome dev abilities and the deep metrics that New Relic provides.

Step 6
-------
Let us know how you did, what you liked or disliked, what helped you find problems or what were the challenges, what you like about New Relic or Windows Azure and what you don't - we just want to hear from you and see what we can do to get better. We'll even send you something for demonstrating your geek super powers when you complete the Kata - just provide us with your [thoughts and a link to your forked repo](https://support.newrelic.com/home).
